### Theme Settings (controlled in Admin) ###

* Site Title: "This is a test for the Glowline theme, which is a rubbish name for a website".
* Site Tagline: "This tagline is too long for a normal website but lets see what happens if I keep rambling like this because we want this to be longer than the site title...."
* Blog posts show 5 per page
* Enabled threaded comments 5 levels deep
